# ReactJS Student Management App

> **Note:** I was not able to execute this project in the current environment. However, these are the features that are intended to be included in this folder/project:

## Intended Features
- Add, edit, and delete student records with ease
- Responsive and dynamic user interface for seamless experience
- Organized component structure for scalability and maintainability
- Easy to extend and customize for your own needs

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains all React components, state management logic, and styles
- `public/`: Static assets and the main HTML template

Feel free to enhance the app by adding authentication, connecting to a backend, or improving the UI!
