# Servlet-Based Shopping Cart Controller

This experiment introduces Java Servlets for building a shopping cart controller in a web application. It is ideal for learning about server-side Java, MVC architecture, and web deployment.

## Features
- Java Servlet-based controller logic
- Handles shopping cart actions (add, remove, view)
- Organized MVC folder structure
- Example Tomcat server setup

## Folder Structure
- `shopping-cart/src/`: Java source code for the controller
- `WebContent/`: Web resources (JSP, HTML, WEB-INF)
- `lib/`: Libraries and Tomcat server files
- `src/`: Additional Java source files

## How to Use
1. Import the project into Eclipse or your preferred IDE.
2. Deploy to Apache Tomcat (see `lib/apache-tomcat-9.0.104/`).
3. Access the app via your browser and interact with the shopping cart.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand Java Servlets and web controllers
- Practice MVC design in Java web apps
- Learn about deployment with Tomcat
