# ReactJS Weather App

> **Note:** I was not able to execute this project in the current environment. However, these are the features that are intended to be included in this folder/project:

## Intended Features
- Search for weather by city name
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions
- Responsive, attractive interface for all devices
- Easy to extend and customize with new features

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: React components, state management, and styles
- `public/`: Static assets and HTML template

---
Try adding more weather features, such as forecasts, location-based search, or advanced visualizations!
