# Node.js Student API

This project is a RESTful API for managing student records, built with Node.js. It is ideal for learning about Express.js, REST principles, and backend development.

## Features
- CRUD operations for student data
- RESTful API endpoints
- Modular code structure
- Easy to extend and integrate

## Folder Structure
- `index.js`: Entry point for the API server
- `students.js`: Student data and logic
- `package.json`: Project dependencies

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `node index.js`
3. Use Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints

## Learning Outcomes
- Build RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express
- Organize backend code for scalability
- Practice API testing and integration
