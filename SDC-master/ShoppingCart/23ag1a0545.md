//JavaScript Usage in Registration Page//
The registration.html page includes JavaScript for client-side form validation. This ensures that users enter valid data before submitting the form. Below is an explanation of how JavaScript is used:

#Key JavaScript Features
Form Validation:

The validate() function is triggered when the "SUBMIT" button is clicked.

It checks if all required fields are filled correctly before allowing form submission.

#Validation Steps:

Username Validation: Ensures that the username is at least 8 characters long.

Password Validation: Ensures the password is at least 6 characters long.

Email Validation: Checks for the presence of an '@' symbol to verify a valid email format.

Phone Number Validation: Ensures that the phone number is exactly 10 digits and contains only numbers.

Gender Selection Validation: Ensures that either "Male" or "Female" is selected.

Language Selection Validation: Ensures that at least one language is selected.

Address Validation: Ensures that the address field is not empty.

#Alerts for Errors:

If any field fails validation, an alert message is displayed, and the form submission is stopped.

Example: alert("Please enter a valid Phone Number");

#Success Message:

If all validations pass, an alert message "Registration Successful" is shown.
