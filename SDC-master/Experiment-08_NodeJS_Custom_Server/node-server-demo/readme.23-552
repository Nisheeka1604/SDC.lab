# Node.js Custom Server Demo

This experiment demonstrates how to build a custom HTTP server using Node.js. It is a great way to learn about Node.js core modules, event-driven programming, and server-side JavaScript.

## Features
- Custom HTTP server implementation
- Handles multiple routes and events
- Demonstrates Node.js core modules (fs, os, path)
- Simple, well-commented code

## Folder Structure
- `eventDemo.js`, `osInfo.js`, `pathDemo.js`: Node.js demo scripts
- `server.js`: Main server file

## How to Use
1. Install Node.js if you haven't already.
2. Run `node server.js` in the terminal.
3. Access the server via your browser or tools like Postman.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand Node.js event loop and modules
- Build and extend custom servers
- Practice server-side JavaScript
