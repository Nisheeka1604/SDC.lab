# Java Standalone CRUD App with MySQL

This project demonstrates a standalone Java application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database. It is perfect for learning about JDBC, database connectivity, and Java application structure.

## Features
- Connects to a MySQL database
- Add, update, delete, and view records
- Console-based user interface
- Well-organized source code

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Java source files for CRUD operations
- `bin/`: Compiled Java classes
- `lib/`: External libraries (e.g., MySQL connector)
- `sql.txt`: SQL scripts for database setup

## How to Use
1. Set up a MySQL database using the provided `sql.txt` script.
2. Compile the Java files in `src/` (use the libraries in `lib/`).
3. Run the application from the command line or your IDE.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand JDBC and database operations in Java
- Practice organizing Java projects
- Learn to handle user input and database errors
