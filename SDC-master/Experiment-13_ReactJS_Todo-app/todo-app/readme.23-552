# ReactJS To-Do App

> **Note:** I was not able to execute this project in the current environment. However, these are the features that are intended to be included in this folder/project:

## Intended Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks quickly
- Mark tasks as complete or pending
- Clean, responsive UI for all devices
- Organized codebase for easy learning and extension

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: React components, state logic, and styles
- `public/`: Static assets and HTML template

---
Try adding user authentication, task filters, or persistent storage for more advanced features!
