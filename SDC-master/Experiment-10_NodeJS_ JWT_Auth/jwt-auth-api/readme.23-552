# Node.js JWT Authentication API

This project demonstrates how to implement JWT-based authentication in a Node.js API. It is perfect for learning about secure authentication, middleware, and token management.

## Features
- User registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation
- Protected API routes
- Modular controllers and middleware

## Folder Structure
- `app.js`, `index.js`: Main server files
- `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `routes/`: Organized code for scalability
- `package.json`: Project dependencies

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `node index.js`
3. Use Postman to register, login, and access protected routes

## Learning Outcomes
- Implement JWT authentication in Node.js
- Secure API endpoints with middleware
- Understand token-based security
