# Session Management Experiment

This project explores session management in Java web applications. It demonstrates how to maintain user state, handle logins, and manage transactions securely.

## Features
- User login and session tracking
- Transaction management
- Secure session handling
- Example servlets for login and transactions

## Folder Structure
- `Shopping-cart/`: Source code and resources for the shopping cart
- `index.html`: Entry point for the app
- `LoginServlet.java`, `TransactionServlet.java`: Java servlets for session logic

## How to Use
1. Import the project into your Java IDE.
2. Deploy to a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).
3. Open `index.html` and test login/session features.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand session management in web apps
- Practice secure coding for user authentication
- Learn servlet-based web development
